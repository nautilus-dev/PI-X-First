# PI-X-First


This is our proposal for the PI-X-First algorithm which is an extension of the PI-First algorithm.

PI denotes the round in which the heuristic is stopping to do exploring and switches to the exploitation phase,
X represents the number of Worker Agents (WA) to use when this switch is effective.
